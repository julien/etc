deansi
======
Removes ANSI escape codes:

deansi (written in Zig as a learning exercise, don't expect much) reads from
standard input or from a list of files, strips out any ANSI escape sequences
(like color codes or cursor movement codes), and prints the cleaned text to
standard output.

To build (and if zig is installed), run:

    zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall

Usage:
Either pipe the output of another command into `deansi`:

	ls -ahl --color=always $HOME | ./zig-out/bin/deansi | cat -v

or pass one or more file paths as arguments and their "cleaned" content
will be written to standard output:

Examples:
	./zig-out/bin/deansi log1.log
or
	./zig-out/bin/deansi log1.log log2.log > combined.log
