deansi
======
Removes ANSI escape codes:

deansi reads from standard input or from a list of files, strips out any ANSI
escape sequences (like color codes or cursor movement codes), and prints the
cleaned text to standard output.

Usage:
Either pipe the output of another command into `deansi`:

	ls -ahl --color=always $HOME | deansi | cat -v

or pass one or more file paths as arguments and their "cleaned" content
will be written to standard output:

Examples:
	deansi log1.log
or
	deansi log1.log log2.log > combined.log
